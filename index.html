    <p>I have worked on two projects with Github which I have both used html and css languages the first one talks about property management where the real estate investors work in one company to perform investments.The second is about counselling where Skika Company was formed in 2017 to help people from humble backgrounds that could not afford professional guidance and counselling.</p>
